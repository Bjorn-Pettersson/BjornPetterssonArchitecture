                        The assignment was to make a cultural center at the overgrown wasteland of Sydhavnstippen. 
                        <br>The place have slowly transformed from a pile of concrete and building waste, 
                        <br>to a grass covered nature reserve where people come to get away from the city. 
                        <br>My approach to the site was to make a building that resembles something from the original place, 
                        <br>a solid block rather than a building, a wasteland sculpture. The idea was to eliminate the elements 
                        <br>that is characteristic for a building such as windows and doors to achieve this expression. This was to preserve the 
                        <br>feeling of unexplioted land as a contrast to the city through the sculptural approach.
